            <h3>Responsive website design:</h3>
            <p class="declaration-text">
                Responsive web design is an approach to building a website that considers the different 
                types of devices that a visitor might use to access the site. Responsive web design adjusts 
                how content on a page is displayed according to the dimensions of the device’s screen. This 
                is in direct contrast with non-responsive web design, which maintains the same properties 
                regardless of what size screen is being used.<br>
                An example of a non-responsive web design page is one that reads well on desktop browsers but 
                has very small, unreadable text on smartphones, often due to having too many columns or images 
                that are too large to fit within a smartphone’s limited viewport display width. With responsive 
                web design, web developers don’t have to focus on specific display sizes; rather, their 
                responsive web code is designed to automatically adapt to a range of display sizes.
            </p>
            <h3>Responsive design relate to web technologies:</h3>
            <p class="declaration-text">
                Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the 
                appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used 
                to view it. RWD is one approach to the problem of designing for the multitude of devices available 
                to customers, ranging from tiny phones to huge desktop monitors.<br>
                RWD uses so-called breakpoints to determine how the layout of a site will appear: one design is 
                used above a breakpoint and another design is applied below that breakpoint. The breakpoints are 
                commonly based on the width of the browser.<br>
                RWD has potential advantages over developing separate sites for different device types. The use of a 
                single codebase can make development faster, compared to developing 3 or 4 distinct sites, and makes 
                maintenance easier over time, as one set of code and content needs to be updated rather than 3 or 4. 
                RWD is also relatively “future-proof” in that it can support new breakpoints needed at any time. If a 
                5-inch device or 15-inch device takes off in the market, the code can support the new devices. RWD doesn’t 
                tie design to a particular device.

            <h3>What I learned about building web apps for different devices through research:</h3>
            <p class="declaration-text">
                I learned a lot by resaerch that how to make a responsive and attractive design that don’t
                irritate users on any of their device.After facing different problems while doing this and 
                then in finding the solutions for those problems i really learned a lot and it's a wonderfull
                experience for me.
